# MailMyPDF Remote MCP Connector

MailMyPDF exposes a vendor-neutral MCP surface so ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Codex, and other compatible clients can use the same workflow engine.

## Endpoint

The host app mounts the connector at:

```
POST /api/mcp
```

The connector is deliberately an adapter over the existing generic workflow runtime. It does not implement a second matter store, document system, packet builder, pricing engine, payment system, or Lob integration.

## v0.2 tool boundary

Public discovery:

- `find_workflow`
- `get_workflow`

Authenticated matter execution:

- `get_profile`
- `create_matter`
- `get_matter`
- `ingest_document`
- `save_matter_input`
- `analyze_matter`
- `generate_draft`
- `save_draft`
- `preview_packet`
- `approve_packet`
- `prepare_checkout`

The connector intentionally does **not** expose a raw-card tool or a model-authorized "mail now" tool.

`approve_packet` is bound server-side to the exact packet SHA-256, exact price, recipient, and mail class. `prepare_checkout` can only run against that saved approval and returns the existing Stripe-hosted checkout path. Existing payment and fulfillment infrastructure remains authoritative.

## Secure assistant attachments

`ingest_document` accepts the provider-neutral file object used by ChatGPT file parameters:

```json
{
  "download_url": "https://temporary-provider-url/...",
  "file_id": "provider-file-id",
  "mime_type": "application/pdf",
  "file_name": "notice.pdf"
}
```

The tool is marked with `_meta["openai/fileParams"] = ["file"]`, so ChatGPT can supply an attached file directly. Other MCP clients can pass the same shape when they expose temporary file URLs.

Ingress is intentionally not a blind URL fetch:

- the matter is owner-checked before any remote network request;
- only public HTTPS URLs on port 443 are accepted;
- local/private/IP-literal targets and unsafe redirect destinations are rejected;
- deployments can further restrict hosts with `MCP_REMOTE_FILE_HOSTS`;
- response and provider MIME claims are treated as untrusted;
- binary signatures are checked before creating the File object;
- streaming size caps are enforced before the whole response can exceed MailMyPDF limits;
- the bytes then pass through the existing secure-document consent, validation, SHA-256, quarantine, retention, and malware-scan lifecycle;
- the attached document remains unusable for analysis until its security status becomes `clean`.

A user attaching a file is not approval to mail it. `processing_consent` must be true for ingestion, and exact packet approval plus checkout remain separate actions.

## Authentication

MailMyPDF uses the existing Supabase Auth user base as the OAuth 2.1 authorization server for remote MCP clients.

Protected tools validate the resulting Supabase access token through the same server-side `getUser(token)` boundary used by the authenticated web app, so existing owner-scoped RLS remains authoritative.

The application includes a branded consent route:

```
/oauth/consent
```

and protected-resource metadata:

```
GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
```

When `SUPABASE_URL` is configured, resource metadata automatically advertises `${SUPABASE_URL}/auth/v1` as the authorization server. `MCP_AUTHORIZATION_SERVER` remains an optional override for unusual deployments.

For the hosted Supabase project, enable:

1. OAuth 2.1 Server.
2. Authorization Path: `/oauth/consent`.
3. Dynamic client registration for MCP clients.
4. Explicit user consent for every new client.

Supabase currently supports the standard `email` and `profile` scopes used by MailMyPDF's protected MCP tools. Application-specific permissions such as matter ownership and exact mailing approval are enforced by MailMyPDF server policy/RLS rather than unsupported custom OAuth scopes.

For local Supabase, the equivalent settings are committed in `mailmypdf/supabase/config.toml`.

Do not treat OAuth consent as authorization to mail. Packet approval and checkout remain separate server-side actions.

## Next execution milestones

1. Enable/verify Supabase OAuth 2.1 settings on the hosted project and exercise a real dynamic-client login.
2. Exercise `ingest_document` against real ChatGPT/Claude/Grok attachment URLs and configure `MCP_REMOTE_FILE_HOSTS` if stable provider/CDN domains are available.
3. Add an order-status tool backed by the canonical order/fulfillment records.
4. Add saved-payment support only after a server-side confirmation design is complete.
5. Add MCP Apps review UI for exact PDF, recipient, service, and price confirmation.
6. Package OpenAI-specific skills/manifest after the production MCP URL is stable.

The connector must remain useful without custom UI; UI is a review surface, not an authorization bypass.
